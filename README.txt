Robots is a game of strategy that requires a bit of luck.  You, "the player" are surrounded in a grid full of robots.  You can not defeat them yourself, but luckily, you can make them destroy eachother.		Move around the board  width the numpad on your keyboard with numlock on. '5' lets the robots move toward you while all the other numbers move you in direction that they are from the '5' key (2 = S, 7 = NW, etc, ...).
	The robots move just like you do, but in response to your move.  The try to get on the same row and column of the grid you are at, changing their location by one spot per your move.  Luckily for you, if you can not make any moves without getting killed, or if you wish, you can randomly teleport to somewhere on the grid.  Teleport by pressing the '+' key on the numpad.  Be careful, this can be risky, for if the player lands on or near a robot you will be killed.  Some game modes give the player a  "safe" teleport" option, 1 given for each level.  The player can choose to not use or save the teleport for a later time by pressing '*' on the numpad in a "safe teleports" mode.
