Robots is a game of strategy that requires a bit of luck.  You, "the 
player," are surrounded in a grid full of robots.  You can not defeat 
them yourself, but luckily, you can make them destroy eachother.  Move 
around the board width the numpad on your keyboard with numlock on. '5' 
lets the robots move toward you while all the other numbers move you in 
direction that they are from the '5' key (2 = S, 7 = NW, etc, ...).  The
robots move just like you do, but in response to your move.  They try 
to get on the same row and column of the grid you are at, changing their
location by one spot per your move.  Luckily for you, if you can not
make any moves without getting killed, or if you wish, you can randomly 
teleport to somewhere on the grid.  Teleport by pressing the '+' key on 
the numpad.  Be careful, this can be risky, for if the player lands on 
or near a robot you will be killed.  Some game modes give the player a  
"safe" teleport" option, 1 given for each level.  The player can choose 
to not use or save the teleport for a later time by pressing '*' on the 
numpad in a "safe teleports" mode.
	Another nifty little trick to escape harm is to move Wrecks.  A 
Wreck can be pushed out of the way in order to escape harm as long as 
The Wreck is not pushed off the board.  Be careful!  Pushing a Wreck 
does not mean a move is necessarily safe.  Robots may still run into you
if you are close.  If a Robot is on the other side of the Wreck, you 
will "splat!" it by pushing the Wreck, which is always fun to do.
